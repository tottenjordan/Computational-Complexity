    "In this notebook, Gurobi Optimizer is used to illustrate the computational complexity of the TSP. We divide the TSP into two models of (1) 30 nodes and (2) 253 nodes. to define the nodes, we use GPS coordinates of the 30 active MLB ballparks and the 253 locations around the globe which have ever held a MLB game. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the program uses brute force calculation on both models, an optimal solution is attainable for the 30-node model. due to our time limits, the algorithm is forced to converge on an approximate solution for the 253-node model."

    "The purpose of this project was to explore TSP and the computational complexity surrounding it. The\n",
    "exercise analyzed two sizes of a TSP, (1) a 30-ballpark problem and (2) a 253-ballpark problem. As\n",
    "mentioned, the program converged on a solution in less than a second for the 30-ballpark problem.\n",
    "However, the larger problem failed to converge in as long as 12 hours. As a result, candidate solutions\n",
    "for the larger problem were obtained through solver runs of varying times; candidate solutions saw their\n",
    "errors decrease in proportion with the solver time that had been allotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "TSP optimization is an NP-Hard problem; regardless of the size of the problem. As it\n",
    "stands, solutions cannot be presented in polynomial time nor can solutions be verified in polynomial\n",
    "time. The factorial nature of the TSP creates computational complexity which limits modern computing\n",
    "like our program. Our problem was relatively simplistic in its setup. It was considered\n",
    "symmetric; it did not investigate transitions between various modes of travel; it did not reconcile the\n",
    "feasibility of applying Manhattan distance measures in urban areas. Despite the problem was stripped to\n",
    "the simplest TSP interpretation, the larger problem could not converge to an optimal solution."
